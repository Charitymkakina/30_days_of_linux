To create a journal entry; open a new file: command ~/30_days_liux/day2_notes.md
You should type your notes: Day 2: I am learning to edit a file without a mouse. Nano uses shortcuts at the bottom of the screen
The shortcuts (ctrl+o: write out: (^+o)), then press enter to exit the text editor, and press ctrl+x.
To make the file a read-only file for everyone's use, use chmod 444, then your text file (.txt)
In windows you have C:\ and D:\. In linux everything starts from the root (/):
/home/user: Where your files live
/etc: Where system settings live
/bin: Where your commands (like ls) live
