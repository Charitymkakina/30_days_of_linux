Tasks
Filter the ~/project/logs/app.log file to find all lines containing the word ERROR.
Save the filtered lines to a new file named ~/project/error_report.txt.
Requirements
You must use a command-line tool to search the file.
The input file for your search is ~/project/logs/app.log.
The output must be saved in a file named ~/project/error_report.txt in the ~/project directory.
The output file should only contain the lines with the word ERROR.

Solution:
Command: grep "ERROR" ~/project/logs/app.log ~/project/error_report.txt
Command: cat ~/project/error_report.txt

Tasks
Examine the system's kernel messages for any lines related to fail or error.
Save these findings into a file named ~/project/boot_issues.txt.
Requirements
You must use the dmesg command to view kernel messages.
Your search for fail or error should be case-insensitive.
The results must be saved to a file named ~/project/boot_issues.txt.
Note: You may need administrative privileges (sudo) to access kernel messages.

Solution:
sudo grep -iE "pass|error" > ~/project/boot_issues.txt
cat ~/project/boot_issues.txt

Tasks
Search the web server configuration file at ~/project/config/nginx.conf.
Find the line containing the worker_processes directive.
Append this line to the ~/project/error_report.txt file you created in the first step.
Requirements
The input file is ~/project/config/nginx.conf.
You must append the result to ~/project/error_report.txt, not overwrite it.

Solution:
grep "worker_processes" ~/project/config/nginx.conf >> ~/project/error_report.txt
cat ~/project/error_report.txt

Compare the staging configuration file ~/project/config/staging/app.conf with the production configuration file ~/project/config/production/app.conf.
Save the differences to a new file named ~/project/config_diff.txt.
Requirements
You must use the diff command.
The output showing the differences must be saved to ~/project/config_diff.txt.
Solution:
diff ~/project/config/staging/app.conf ~/project/config/production/app.conf > ~/project/config_diff.txt
cat ~/project/config_diff.txt

Tasks
You have two directories: /home/labex/project/server1_files (representing the staging server) and /home/labex/project/server2_files (representing the production server).
Compare these two directories to find out which files are unique to server1_files.
Save the complete comparison output to a file named /home/labex/project/missing_files.txt.
Requirements
You must use the diff command to compare the two directories.
The output must be saved to /home/labex/project/missing_files.txt.

Solution:
diff -r /home/labex/project/server1_files /home/labex/project/server2_files > /home/labex/project/missing_files.txt
cat /home/labex/project/missing_files.txt
