Linux is based on the UNIX operating system. UNIX is a powerful, multi-user, multitasking operating system. UNIX laid the foundation for many operating systems, including Linux.
Linux is free and open source, accessible to everyone.
This promotes global collaboration and innovation.
Linux offers efficient performance and strong security.
It works well across many devices and industries.
Linux combines a wide range of open-source tools and components to form a complete computing environment. These components include file systems, userinterfaces, system utilities, and application
programs, all working together to manage hardware and enable users to interact with their computer systems.

DISTRIBUTIONS IN LINUX
-A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel, combined with system software, libraries, and applications.
It provides users with everything needed to run Linux on different types of devices.
Major Linux family distribution
-The Red Hat family- Fedora serves as an upstream testing platform. Widely used by enterprises.
-The SUSE family- Known for the YaST configuration tool and strong enterprise backing. OpenSUSE offers both stable and rolling releases, while the SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) is the commercial version for mission-critical applications.
-Debian family- Known for stability and the APT package manager. Debian is highly stable, suitable for servers and experienced users. Ubuntu is very user-friendly and popular for desktops and cloud
Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, designed for ease of use and Windows switchers. Lastly, Kali Linux is specialized for penetration testing and cybersecurity

Linux terminology and examples
1. Kernel- This is the brain of the Linux OS. Controls the hardware and makes the hardware interact wth applications. Example: Linux Kernel
2. Distribution- Collection of software making up a Linux-based OS. Example: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Gentoo, and Ubuntu.
3. BootLoader- A program that boots the operating system. example: GRUB and ISOLinux.
4. Service- A program that runs as a background process. Example: httpd-webserver, ftpd-Ftp server, named-name server
5. File system- Method for storing and organizing files. Examples: ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS, NTFS,
and Btrfs
6. The X Window system- It provides the standard toolkit and protocol to build a graphical user interface on nearly all Linux systems.
7. Desktop environment- A graphical user interface on top of the operating system, example: GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and Fluxbox
8. Commandline- Interface for typing commands on top of the OS. Shell command line interpreter interprets the command line input and instructs the OS to perform any necessary tasks and commands, for example: bash

Boot Process
The boot includes:
-BIOS, this is the first step- When the computer is powered on, the BIOS initializes the screen and keyboard and tests the main memory. This is also referred to as POST (Power on self test). Bios is stored on the ROM chip on the motherboard. The remainder of the boot process is controlled by the OS.
-Master Boot Record (MBR) and Bootloader: Once the POST is completed, system control passes from the firmware (BIOS or UEFI) to the bootloader. To achieve this, the firmware performs its first access of mass storage media to locate the boot code. In legacy BIOS systems, this code is stored in the Master Boot Record (MBR) within the first sector of the disk. 
In modern UEFI systems, the firmware accesses the EFI System Partition (ESP) to execute a bootloader file (like .efi). Up to this stage, while the hardware has been initialized and the boot sector read, the Operating System itself has not yet been loaded into memory. Thereafter, information on date and time is loaded from the CMOS battery.
-Kernel Linux OS- When booting Linux, the bootloader is responsible for loading the kernel image and the initial RAM disk or file system into memory. The bootloader in action has two distinct stages:
 -For systems using the BIOS MBR method- The bootloader resides on the first sector of the hard disk, also known as the master boot record. The size of the MBR is 512 bytes, the bootloader exam is the partition table, and it finds a bootable partition. Once it finds a bootable partition, it then searches for the second-stage bootloader, for
example, GRUB, and loads it into RAM for systems using the EFI/UFI method. The UEFI firmware reads its boot manager data to determine which UEFI application is to be launched and from where. The firmware then launches the UEFI application, for example, GRUB, to find the boot entry in the firmware's boot manager.
 -The second stage of the bootloader resides under /boot- A screen is displayed which allows us to choose which OS to boot. After choosing the OS, the bootloader loads the kernel of the selected OS into RAM and passes control to it. Kernels are always compressed. The first job is to uncompress itself. After this, it will check and analyze the system
hardware and initialize any hardware device drivers built into the kernel.
