Linux is based on the UNIX operating system. UNIX is a powerful, multi-user, multitasking operating system. UNIX laid the foundation for many operating systems, including Linux.
Linux is free and open source, accessible to everyone.
This promotes global collaboration and innovation.
Linux offers efficient performance and strong security.
It works well across many devices and industries.
Linux combines a wide range of open-source tools and components to form a complete computing environment. These components include file systems, userinterfaces, system utilities, and application
programs, all working together to manage hardware and enable users to interact with their computer systems.

DISTRIBUTIONS IN LINUX
-A Linux distribution is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel, combined with system software, libraries, and applications.
It provides users with everything needed to run Linux on different types of devices.
Major Linux family distribution
-The Red Hat family- Fedora serves as an upstream testing platform. Widely used by enterprises.
-The SUSE family- Known for YasT configuration tool and strong enterprise backing. OpenSUSE offers both stable and rolling releases, while the SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLES) is the commercial version for mission-critical applications.
-Debian family- Known for stability and the APT package manager. Debian is highly stable, suitable for servers and experienced users. Ubuntu is very user-friendly and popular for desktops and cloud
Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, designed for ease of use and Windows switchers. Lastly, Kali Linux is specialized for penetration testing and security

Linux terminology and examples
1. Kernel- This is the brain of the Linux OS. Controls the hardware and makes the hardware interact wth applications. Example: Linux Kernel
2. Distribution- Collection of software making up a Linux-based OS. Example: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Gentoo, and Ubuntu.
3. BootLoader- A program that boots the operating system. example: GRUB and ISOLinux.
4. Service- A program that runs as a background process. Example: httpd-webserver, ftpd-Ftp server, named-name server
5. File system- Method for storing and organizing files. Examples: ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS, NTFS and Btrfs
6. The X Window system- It provides the standardd tool kit and protocol to build a graphical user interface on nearly all Linux systems.
7. Desktop environment- A graphical user interface on top of the operating system example: GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and Fluxbox
8. Commandline- Interface for typing commands on top of the OS. Shell command line interperter interprets the command line input and instructs the OS to perform any necessary tasks and commands, example: bash
