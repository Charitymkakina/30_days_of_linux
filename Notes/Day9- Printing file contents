echo "Hi, I am labby!" > /tmp/hello
cat /tmp/hello
cat command displays the contents of the file
Therefore, the output after running cat /tmp/hello is Hi, I am labby!

PRINTING NEWLINE ESCAPE
Method 1: using echo
echo -e "Hi,\nI am labby!" > /tmp/hello
cat /tmp/hello
output: Hi,
        I am labby!

Method 2: using printf
printf "Hi,\nI am labby!\n" > /tmp/hello

Method 3: Using Nano
bash: nano /tmp/hello
type: Hi,
      I am labby!
save: ctrl+O then ENTER then crtl+x to exit

Displaying the file contents with line numbers:
command: cat -n /tmp/hello
output: 1 Hi,
        2 i am labby!
head -n1 /tmp/hello the n1 option tells head to show only the first line
output: Hi,

View the first few bytes of a file:
head -c1 /tmp/hello
output: H

Print the last lines of a file

Comparing files 
We are going to use diff
Creating a directory we are going to use it: mkdir -p ~/code
echo "this is file1" > ~/Desktop/file1.txt
echo "this is file2" > ~/code/file1.txt
diff -r ~/Desktop ~/code
Output:
       1c1
       <this is file1
       ---
       >this is file2
Explanation:
1c1 means line 1 of the file in the first directory is different from line 1 of the file in the second directory
c stands for change
<this is file1 means the content of line 1 in the first file in the desktop directory
--- separator between the two versions
>this is file2, the content of line 1 in the second file, which is in the code directory
