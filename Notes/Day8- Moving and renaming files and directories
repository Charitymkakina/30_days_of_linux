Rename a file- mv file1.txt newname.txt
Move a file to a directory- mv newname.txt testdir/
Rename a directory- mv testdir_copy new_testdir
Move and rename in one command- mv testdir/newname.txt ./original_file1.txt
verify: ls
        ls testdir

REMOVING FILES AND DIRECTORIES
Removing a single file- rm original_file1.txt 
verify using ls to confirm if original_file1 has been removed
Removing interactively- rm -i file2.txt (-i) allows you to be prompted with y (yes) or n (no)for your confirmation before deleting
Remove empty directory- rmdir new_testdir 
Remove directory and its contents- rm -r testdir
Force removal (to be used with extreme caution, as it can delete files permanently, even if they are write-protected): rm -rf /

To demonstrate forceful deletion
mkdir temp_dir
touch temp_dir/temp_file.txt
ls -R temp_dir
Note: The capital R used here is referred to as recursive listing
to forcefully remove: rm -rf temp_dir
