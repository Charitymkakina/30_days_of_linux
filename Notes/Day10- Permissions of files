make directory: mkdir ~/project
change directory: cd ~/project
Creating a new file: touch example.txt
Verifying the presence of the new file- ls

Changing Ownership of a File
Checking the current ownership of the file: 
Command: ls -l
Output: -rw-rw-r--1 charity charity 0 feb 16 16:01 example.txt
Meaning: (-rw-rw-r--1) represents the file permissions
         (1st charity) represents the current owner of the file
         (2nd charity) represents the current group of the file.
         (0) represents the file size in bytes.
         (feb 16 16:01) represents the last modified date and time.
To change the user and group, we create a user and group first, since they don't exist on my machine
To create a group: sudo groupadd developer
To create user: sudo useradd -g developer labby
To change the ownership of a file: sudo chown labby:developer example.txt
Verifying the changes: ls -l
Output: -rw-rw-r--1 labby developer 0 feb 16 16:01 example.txt

Changing Ownership of a Directory
1. Create a new directory with some files
command: mkdir -p new-dir/subdir
         echo "Hello, world" > new-dir/file1.txt
         echo "Another file" > new-dir/subdir/file2.txt
Verify: ls -R new-dir
Changing ownership:
Create the user first: sudo useradd -g group1 user1
Create the group: sudo groupadd group1
changing ownership: sudo chown -R user1:group1 new-dir
Verifying: ls -l new-dir

Changing the permissions of a file
- In Linux, file permissions are represented by a series of letters or numbers.
- Understanding the permissions is vital for securing your files and preventing unauthorized access
Command: ls - l example.txt
Output: -rw-rw-r--1 labby developer 0 feb 16 16:01 example.txt
Command: sudo chmod 700 example.txt
Output: -rwx------ 1 charity charity 0 Feb 16 16:06 example.txt

Changing the Permission of a Directory
Command: mkdir ~/test-dir
Command: chmod 700 ~/test-dir
Verification: ls -ld ~/test-dir
Output: drwx-------2 charity charity 4096 feb 16 21:17
Command: chmod -R 755 ~/test-dir
Verification: ls -ld ~/test-dir
Output: drwxr-xr-x 2 charity charity 4096 feb 16 21.17

Using Symbolic Notation for Permissions
-Symbolic notation can be more intuitive, especially when you only want to change a single permission. 
Symbolic notation uses letters to represent the user group and others, and operators to add or remove permissions.
- We will first create a new script file with some content
Command: cd ~/project
Command: echo '#!/bin/bash\necho "Hello, world"' > script.sh
Verification: ls -l script.sh
Output: -rw-rw-r--1 charity charity 33 feb 16 21:25 script.sh
Test: ./script.sh
Output: permission denied
Command: chmod u+x script.sh
Verification: ls -l script.sh
Output: -rwxrw-r--1 charity charity 33 feb 16 21:25 script.sh
Test: ./script.sh
Output: Hello, world
