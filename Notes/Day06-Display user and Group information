Echo simply repeats whatever you tell it
Command: echo "Learning Linux is fun."
Output is: Learning Linux is fun
NOTE: Linux is case sensitive. echo, Echo, and ECHO are all different

To display the current user
command: whoami
This prints the effective username of the current user.

Displaying user and group information
- In Linux user are organized into groups. These groups determine the permissions and access rights a user has
Run: id
The command id outputs: uid- This is the userid, gid- Your primary groupid, and groups- All the groups you are a member
Run: id root
The command: Enable the root, who is the superuser, like the administrator of a system look up other
The command id -un prints only your username. The name for your current UID

FILE OPERATIONS
In Linux, each user typically has a home directory represented by a ~
pwd- shows your current location. (Print working directory)
echo ~ : Displays the path to your home directory
ls- Shows the content of your current directory by listing files and directories
ls ~ : Checks the contents of your home directory

NAVIGATING THE FILE SYSTEM
Linus uses a hierarchical file system. Think of it like a tree with branches. The stem(trunk) is called the "root directory" that is represented by a single forward slash (/).
All other directories and files branch out from this root.
 NOTE: This command: cd /home/charity gets you back to the starting point ( (/home/charity). This is my path in my virtualbox.)
cd .. moves up one level to the parent directory. (..) means the "directory above."
cd charity (this is my path to my Ubuntu terminal in my virtualbox) returns to your project directory.
cd ~ takes you to your home directory.
Absolute path- It starts from the root (/) and gives the full location. In my case its (cd /home/charity)
