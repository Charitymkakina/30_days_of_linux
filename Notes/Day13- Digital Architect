Your mission is to architect a clean, logical, and efficient file structure that will support the growing development team. 
By creating proper directories, organizing files, securing backups, and cleaning up old data, you'll establish the foundation 
that Project Phoenix needs to succeed.

Tasks
Navigate into the ~/project/phoenix_project directory.
Create three new subdirectories: src for source code, config for configuration files, and docs for documentation.
Requirements
All new directories must be created inside the ~/project/phoenix_project directory.
The directory names must be exactly src, config, and docs.
You should use a single command to create all three directories simultaneously.

Solution:
pwd- To check the current directory
Changing the directory: cd ~/project/phoenix_project directory
mkdir src config docs
Verify: ls -f
