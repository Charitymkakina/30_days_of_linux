Your mission is to architect a clean, logical, and efficient file structure that will support the growing development team. 
By creating proper directories, organizing files, securing backups, and cleaning up old data, you'll establish the foundation 
that Project Phoenix needs to succeed.

Tasks
Navigate into the ~/project/phoenix_project directory.
Create three new subdirectories: src for source code, config for configuration files, and docs for documentation.
Requirements
All new directories must be created inside the ~/project/phoenix_project directory.
The directory names must be exactly src, config, and docs.
You should use a single command to create all three directories simultaneously.

Solution:
pwd- To check the current directory
Changing the directory: cd ~/project/phoenix_project directory
mkdir src config docs
Verify: ls -f

Tasks
Move the main_app.py file into the src directory.
Move the config.json file into the config directory.
Move the README.md file into the docs directory.
Requirements
Ensure you are in the ~/project/phoenix_project directory before performing the move operations.
Use the mv command to relocate each file.

Solution
cd ~/project/phoenix_project directory
mv main_app.py src/
mv config.json config/
mv README.md docs/

Tasks
Create a backup copy of the config.json file.
Requirements
The backup file must be created within the ~/project/phoenix_project/config/ directory.
The backup file must be named exactly config.json.bak.

Solution:
cp config/config.json config/config.json.bak
cd ~/project/phoenix_project directory/config
ls 
output: config.json config.json.bak

Tasks
Move the entire shared_docs directory and all of its contents into the ~/project/phoenix_project/docs/ directory.
Requirements
The source directory is ~/project/shared_docs.
The destination path is ~/project/phoenix_project/docs/.
The entire directory, not just its contents, must be moved.

Solution
mv ~/project/shared_docs ~/project/phoenix_project/docs
cd ~/project/phoenix_project/docs
ls
Output: README.md shared_docs

Tasks
Navigate to the ~/project/logs directory.
Create a compressed tar archive named old_logs.tar.gz that contains all log files from the year 2023.
After the archive is successfully created, delete the original 2023 log files that you just archived.
Requirements
The final archive must be named exactly old_logs.tar.gz.
The archive must be located in the ~/project/logs directory.
Only log files with 2023 in their name should be archived and subsequently removed.
The log file from 2024 (app_2024-05-01.log) must not be included in the archive and must not be deleted.

Solution:
1. Navigate to the logs directory: cd ~/project/logs
2. Create the compressed archive with only 2023 log files: tar -czvf old_logs.tar.gz *2023*.log
3. After confirming the archive is created, delete the original 2023 logs: rm *2023*.log

Use the tar command to create archives. The options -czf are a powerful combination: c (create), z (compress with gzip), and f (specify filename).
You can use a wildcard (*) to select multiple files that match a pattern. For example, *_2023-*.log will match all files that end with .log and have _2023- in their name.
The rm command is used to remove (delete) files. Be careful when using it with wildcards!
