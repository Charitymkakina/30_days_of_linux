ls -l: (-l) is a lowercase L, it provides a "long" format listing. You see additional details like file permissions (drwr-xr-x), owner, size, and modification date
ls -a  shows all files, including the hidden file.
ls -la  combines the long format (-l) with showing all files (-a)

COPYING FILES AND DIRECTORIES
Copy a file- cp file1.txt file1_copy.txt
Copy a file to another directory- cpfile2.txt testdir
copy a directory- cp -r testdir testdir_copy (The -r stands for recursive, it's necessary when copying directories to ensure all contents are copied).
to verify: ls
           ls testdir
           ls testdir_copy
