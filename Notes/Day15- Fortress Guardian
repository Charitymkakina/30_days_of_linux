Creating a Secure file for a new project
Tasks
Create a new, empty file named project_keys.txt inside the ~/project/phoenix_project directory.
Set the permissions for this file so that only the owner has read and write access, and no one else (not even users in the same group) has any access.
Requirements
The file must be named project_keys.txt.
The file must be located at ~/project/phoenix_project/project_keys.txt.
Use the chmod command with numeric notation to set the permissions.

Solution:
pwd
touch ~/project/phoenix_project/project_keys.txt
chmod 600 ~/project/phoenix_project/project_keys.txt
ls -l ~/project/phoenix_project/

Assigning Ownership of Project Resources
Tasks
Change the owner of the ~/project/phoenix_project directory and all its contents to the user dev_lead.
Change the group owner of the ~/project/phoenix_project directory and all its contents to the developers group.
Requirements
The user owner must be dev_lead.
The group owner must be developers.
The ownership change must apply recursively to all files and subdirectories within ~/project/phoenix_project.
You must use the chown command.

Solution:
sudo chown -R dev_lead:developers ~/project/phoenix_project
ls -ld ~/project/phoenix_project
ls -l ~/project/phoenix_project

Securing the Main Project Directory
Tasks
Set the permissions for the ~/project/phoenix_project directory.
Requirements
The owner (dev_lead) must have read, write, and execute permissions.
The group (developers) must have read and execute permissions.
Others must have no permissions.
Use the chmod command to apply these permissions to the ~/project/phoenix_project directory itself (not recursively).
Since the directory is owned by dev_lead, you may need to use sudo to change permissions.

Solution: 
chmod 750 ~/project/phoenix_project
ls -ld ~/project/phoenix_project/

Setting Up Collaborative Permissions for the Dev Team
Tasks
Set a special permission on the ~/project/phoenix_project/src directory that forces all new files and subdirectories created within it to inherit the group ownership from the src directory itself (which is developers).
Requirements
The solution must ensure new files in ~/project/phoenix_project/src are automatically owned by the developers group.
You must use the chmod command to set this special permission.
You may need to use sudo to set permissions on directories owned by other users.

solution:
sudo chmod 2770 ~/project/phoenix_project.src
ls -ld ~/project/pjoenix_project.src
