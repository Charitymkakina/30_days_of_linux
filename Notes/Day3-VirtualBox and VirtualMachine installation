Today, I worked on installing my Virtual Machines using VirtualBox as part of my 30 Days of Linux journey.

Errors & Issues Discovered
While starting the Ubuntu VM, I encountered performance and boot issues. After investigation, I realized the VM required proper resource allocation to run effectively.

Correct Configuration Settings
To stabilize the machine, I adjusted the following:
-Base Memory (RAM):4096 MB
-Virtual CPU: 2 processors
-Network Adapter: NAT
-Video Memory: 128 MB

I also learned that for optimal performance, I should allocate about 50% of my host machine’s resources to the virtual machine — not too low (causes lag) and not too high (affects host OS performance).

Additional Boot Error
After fixing the resource allocation:
The VM started, and I could see the Ubuntu crown-like logo. However, the desktop environment was not loading properly

Root Cause

I discovered the issue was caused by Windows Hyper-V and Windows Isolation being enabled, which conflicts with VirtualBox virtualization.

Solution Steps

1. Disabled Hyper-V and Windows Isolation in Windows Features
2. Restarted my computer
3. Opened Windows PowerShell (Admin)
4. Ran the command: bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
5. Restarted the machine again
6. Launched VirtualBox and started the Ubuntu VM

Outcome
-Ubuntu VM booted successfully
-Desktop environment loaded smoothly
-No more performance or display issues

 Key Takeaways

-Proper resource allocation is critical for VM performance
-Hyper-V conflicts with VirtualBox virtualization
-PowerShell commands can resolve low-level virtualization issues
-Troubleshooting is a major part of system administration and Linux learning
-The ubuntu iso image boots up the operating system to install it.
